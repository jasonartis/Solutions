# CLAUDE.md — Solutions Platform

## What this is

A multi-tenant modular platform: each client engagement produces a **module** built on shared primitives; clients are org users entitled to modules. Full context lives in `docs/` — **treat the docs as the source of truth and keep them current; a change that makes docs stale isn't done.**

## Read before working

1. [docs/00-vision-and-strategy.md](docs/00-vision-and-strategy.md) — why, principles (extract-don't-speculate; one deployment; tenancy isolation is existential)
2. [docs/01-architecture.md](docs/01-architecture.md) — monorepo layout, multi-tenancy/RLS rules, primitives catalog, local dev, batch/live
3. [docs/03-adding-a-module.md](docs/03-adding-a-module.md) — module anatomy, hard rules, process (when touching/creating modules)
4. [docs/04-build-plan.md](docs/04-build-plan.md) — current milestone and order
5. The relevant `docs/modules/*.md` spec — every module decision is recorded there, dated

## Current state (kept lean — full dated journal in docs/history/platform-journal.md)

<!-- MAINTENANCE: this section auto-loads every session, so keep it SHORT. When shipping a
     slice, move the old blow-by-blow into docs/history/platform-journal.md (newest-first)
     and update only the compact "Now / Next / Standing rules" below. A fresh chat must never
     pay for the full journal. See "Session hygiene". -->

**Now (2026-07-27):** Live on prod (solutions-platform.vercel.app; prod Supabase migrated).
**User-model slice 2 scope-aware authority is BUILT + LIVE for all three multi-entity
modules** — classroom (course/class), nail-salon (location), speed-dating (event) — plus the
shared scope-authority engine (`module_caller_covers_rank/role`, docs/03 #16). Working tree
clean; every slice shipped via the full docs/03 #12 rhythm + prod-verify, each backed up first.

**Next / open (pick WITH the founder — do not start unprompted; details in docs/15 §11):**
- Single-entity modules (matchmaking / synagogue-schedules / visual-messaging) NOT yet
  rank-mapped — OPTIONAL (a real behavior change, not cosmetic).
- View-as + everywhere role-clarity labels (founder testing-round items 31–42) — high value.
- Slice 3 (join policies + invite-accept), 4 (defaults-on-join), 5 (view-as).
- Deferred platform hardening: platform-wide `revoke PUBLIC` on definer fns; generic
  scope-wrappers deriving org from the entity row; generalize coarse `<prefix>_can_manage(org)`;
  per-class storage scoping; per-module scoped-assignment UIs; "a module_roles grant implies
  org membership" invariant.
- Pre-launch before real customers (docs/12 checklist): automated+tested backups, monitoring,
  2FA, privacy/terms, custom SMTP.

**Standing rules:** never start a slice/module build without the founder initiating; every
migration/RLS/trigger change runs the docs/03 #12 rhythm (draft → adversarial review →
live-verify as real users → RLS tests → docs); model-choice + subagent + fresh-chat guidance
in the sections below.

## Hard-won local-dev gotchas (Windows host)

- Node module compile cache corruption makes pnpm OOM-crash at tiny heaps → delete `%TEMP%\node-compile-cache`.
- PowerShell 5.1 `-Encoding utf8` writes a BOM; the Supabase CLI refuses BOM'd `.env` files. Write env files from Node (scripts/dev.ts) or with BOM-less UTF8.
- After `supabase db reset`, Kong can hold a stale route to the recreated auth container (502 on `/auth/v1/*` while `rest` works) → `docker restart supabase_kong_Solutions_Platform`.
- `import.meta.dirname` is `undefined` under tsx — use `dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url))`.
- Docker Desktop's WSL backend crashed under parallel image pulls → `C:\Users\yarmishj\.wslconfig` caps WSL at 8GB/4CPU (delete to revert); pull images sequentially if it recurs; zero-log segfaulting containers (exit 139) = corrupted image layers, `docker rmi` + re-pull.
- Tables created in CLI migrations do NOT inherit Supabase's default API-role grants — every migration must `grant` explicitly (see 20260706120000_core.sql). **Functions are the inverse trap and dev/prod DIVERGE:** Postgres grants `EXECUTE` to `PUBLIC` at CREATE (so anon can call), and on PROD `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE postgres` ALSO grants `EXECUTE` directly to `anon`/`authenticated` — which `revoke ... from public` does NOT remove. Local lacks that default, so a function locked down with only `revoke ... from public` looks closed locally but is open on prod (the 2026-07-22 `module_scope_covers` gap → `20260722010000`). Rule: state the full intended ACL explicitly (`revoke execute ... from public, anon, authenticated;` then `grant` to exactly who needs it), and verify security-sensitive ACLs against PROD — the local RLS suite can't catch this. See docs/03 convention #1.

## Key standing decisions

- **Stack:** TypeScript, Next.js (App Router), Supabase (Postgres+Auth+Storage+Realtime; local via `supabase start`), Drizzle, pg-boss worker, Tailwind+shadcn/ui, pnpm+Turborepo monorepo. Rationale + alternatives + exit ramps: docs/02.
- **Hosting:** managed-first (Supabase + Vercel free tiers), one small VPS for the worker later, cost phases in docs/05.
- **Security invariant:** every module table has `org_id` + RLS policy; web app queries as the user (RLS enforced); service-role key only in the worker.
- **Code style:** explicit over clever — the founder codes alongside AI (Apps Script/JS background; Copilot may be used too). Fewer abstractions, standard patterns, inline docs where intent isn't obvious.
- Module tables are prefixed (`mm_`, `cls_`, `syn_`, `vm_`, `sal_`, `sd_`); modules never import other modules; shared behavior goes through `packages/platform`.
- **exFAT constraint:** the repo drive (D:) can't do symlinks. NO `workspace:*` dependencies — internal packages are imported via `@platform/*` tsconfig path aliases, and `.npmrc` pins `node-linker=hoisted`. Details + deferred NTFS revert: docs/01.

## Founder profile & working style (canonical — mirror of any session memory)

- **Founder:** Jason (yarmishj@artisenergy.com; platform account jasonartisenergy@gmail.com).
  Google Apps Script/Sheets background; teaches a university course (module 2 mirrors his
  real class workflow); day job at Artis Energy (energy/utility domain — the prior-art
  codebases in docs/06 are his).
- **How he works with AI:** maximum autonomous momentum. His words (2026-07-07): "Ask me as
  little as possible for permissions. Even when you do have something to ask me, you can
  pause to ask but try to work on something else as well while you wait." Batch questions;
  keep an independent track moving while anything is pending; use background tasks and
  parallel agents freely; report outcomes, not requests for permission.
- **Interaction patterns that work:** numbered load-bearing questions (he answers inline,
  point by point); real client artifacts as specs; click-by-click walkthroughs for testing;
  plain-language explanations of infra concepts (he asks — answer directly, no jargon).
- **Code prefs:** explicit TypeScript over clever; few abstractions; inline docs where
  intent isn't obvious; he may read/modify code himself and Copilot may join.
- **Command execution on this machine:** run sandboxed by default — the sandbox-bypass
  flag triggers permission prompts every time and was the main prompt-fatigue source.
  Single commands starting with an allowlisted program (pnpm/git/node/tsx/docker/supabase);
  complex logic goes in script files, not shell one-liners.

## Model choice (founder preference, 2026-07-10; Fable tier added 2026-07-16)

- **Sonnet 5** for routine slices: UI/CRUD work, walkthrough-feedback fixes,
  docs, manifest copies.
- **Opus 4.8 (or better)** for anything touching `supabase/migrations/`, RLS
  policies, triggers, export/privacy rules, or gnarly multi-step debugging.
- **Fable 5 (limited credits — spend deliberately)** only when Opus-tier work
  has an extra reason to want the strongest model:
  - **Adversarial security review of a NOVEL RLS/trigger/privacy design**
    (a new mechanism, not a copy of an existing audited pattern) — tenancy
    isolation is existential, so the review step specifically is where the
    top model earns its cost. Routine "same shape as an existing audited
    policy" migrations stay Opus.
  - **Debugging that has already defeated one session** — a bug Opus/Sonnet
    investigated and misdiagnosed or couldn't reproduce, especially
    cross-layer ones (RLS + trigger + client + infra interacting).
  - **Big cross-cutting design/refactor passes** (extraction passes, a
    platform primitive touching every module) where one wrong abstraction
    is expensive to unwind.
  - NOT for: resuming well-documented in-flight work, building UIs on
    already-verified migrations, docs, seeds, e2e, feedback batches —
    that's Sonnet/Opus territory even when the session started on Fable.
- **Switching has a cost too**: don't churn models mid-task — a mid-session
  switch loses working context. Pick the tier when a work item STARTS; if a
  session's remaining work drops a tier, finish the session, then switch
  down for the next one.
- Whatever the model: the docs/03 #12 security rhythm (agent-draft →
  security-review → live verification) is the invariant, not the model.
- **Two-way say-so rule:** a lighter model whose task drifts into
  heavier territory must SAY SO and suggest switching up — never push
  through quietly. Symmetrically, **a heavier model (Opus/Fable) must say
  at the START of a turn when the requested work doesn't need its tier**
  and recommend the cheaper model for next session — never silently burn
  limited credits on routine work.
- Safeguards, never-do list, backups, recovery: [docs/12-safeguards.md](docs/12-safeguards.md).

## Session hygiene (subagents & fresh chats) — founder ask, 2026-07-27

- **Parallel subagents** — use for independent work that can run concurrently
  (adversarial security reviews, schema/code surveys, migration drafting, RLS-test
  authoring) AND to keep heavy reading/analysis OFF the main context. They trade
  MORE total tokens for parallelism + a leaner main window — they are NOT a way to
  save a token budget. Use only when quality won't suffer: the proven rhythm is
  agent-draft → the orchestrator READS the draft itself → independent 2-reviewer
  adversarial fan-out → test-author → live verify. The orchestrator ALWAYS reviews
  subagent output; the adversarial review + tests are the quality gate, never the
  subagent's own say-so. Token math: subagent overhead dominates in a SMALL context
  (self-do is cheaper there); in a LARGE context their fresh-start saving can
  outweigh it for heavy tasks. The reliable wins are parallelism + context-leanness,
  not budget.
- **Proactively recommend a fresh chat when THIS context grows large.** Per-turn
  cost scales with accumulated context, so a long session gets progressively more
  expensive. When the chat has grown big AND you're at a clean, committed, shipped
  boundary (nothing uncommitted/unpushed), TELL the founder it's a good time to
  start a fresh chat — don't wait to be asked. A fresh chat auto-loads this file +
  docs/15 + docs/03, so nothing is lost. Keep the current-state section above and
  the docs decision logs current so the handoff is always clean.
- **Keep this file (CLAUDE.md) lean — it auto-loads every session, so its size is a
  tax every future chat pays.** As part of the docs-update step when shipping a slice
  (docs/03 #12's final beat), do NOT append the full blow-by-blow to "## Current
  state." Instead: append the detailed dated entry to `docs/history/platform-journal.md`
  (newest-first), and update ONLY the compact "Now / Next / Standing rules" in the
  current-state section here. Durable decisions/conventions go to their real homes
  (docs/15 decision log, docs/03 conventions, docs/12 safeguards), not here. Same
  principle for the other always-loaded lists (gotchas, standing decisions): prune/merge
  rather than let them grow unbounded. A fresh chat should never pay for the full journal.

- Never build platform primitives speculatively — extract them when a second module needs the same thing.
- Migrations: forward-only, additive-first, always run locally before cloud.
- Every module ships with seed data and critical-path e2e tests (each role completes its core task).
- Dated **decisions logs** in module specs record client choices — don't re-litigate them silently; if a decision must change, update the spec with a new dated entry.
