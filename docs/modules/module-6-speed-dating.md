# Module 6: Speed Dating (key: `speed-dating`, prefix `sd_`)

## Problem & context

Live video speed-dating events. Related to module 1 but kept separate (decided); shares primitives (question engine, orgs, matches) through `packages/platform`, never by importing module 1's code. Built **last** (docs/04): depends on stable platform + the two heaviest new pieces (video, live orchestration).

## Roles

- **User** — signs up, fills basic questions/criteria (question-engine primitive), requests to join organizations, signs up for events.
- **Organizer** — event setup: time, eligible users, email alerts to sign up, all timing details, recurring events; live console during events; post-event stats.
- **Host/floater** — organizer's helper: greets the lobby, handles reported rooms; no event-setup rights.
- **Admin** — sets up organizations, organizers, users; platform-wide bans.
- **Observer seats (decided 2026-07-06):** audience members (watch the active room — dating-show format) and mentors (observe + private feedback to their participant). Both require participant consent collected at event signup.

## Event formats (decided 2026-07-06)

Format is configuration, not code: pool definitions (**default: hetero two-sided**, but arbitrary), **counts per side flexible** (7v7 typical; 1v7 dating-show style supported), who rotates, round length (e.g., 7 min), break length (e.g., 30 s) — all set by the organizer at event setup. The same engine can later run networking/mentorship events (keep in mind, don't build for).

## Event experience (user)

- Pre-event **lobby** opens ~15 min early: camera/mic test, waiting room.
- Partner list (e.g., 7 names) on the left; event starts at the designated time; video on; current partner's name highlighted; countdown timer.
- Round ends → video off → break timer → **private notepad** for notes on the last encounter → next round, next name highlighted. Same experience on both sides.
- **Byes** (odd counts / asymmetric pools) get a decent "you're back in next round" screen.
- Notes persist to private history; re-encounter at a future event shows "you met on <date> — your note: …". Organizer setting controls whether repeat pairings are allowed at all.
- End of event, per person met: **interested / no-show / not interested**.
- **Pre-event resume review (decided 2026-07-06):** per-event organizer option, off by default (classic blind format). Opt-in event profile (question answers + short free-text card) shown to scheduled partners before the event or during breaks ("up next: Sarah — her card").

## Matching & reveal

- Mutual interest → both notified; contact shared per user preferences or organizer designation for the event. **One-sided interest reveals nothing.**
- Matches stored in the match DB; feeds the next event's algorithm; future synergy: module 1 compatibility scores seed the rotation (pair high scores in early rounds), and results feed back as signal.

## Orchestration engine (the real module)

- Server-authoritative state machine in the worker: rounds, clock, pairings; Postgres-persisted state + in-memory hot path; **Socket.IO** broadcasts (`round_started`, `break`, `pairing`, announcements) to all participants simultaneously.
- Rotation = round-robin (balanced two-sided: everyone meets everyone in N rounds); handles byes; **enforces block lists and no-repeat-pair settings**; supports live re-pairing.

## Video (decided 2026-07-06 — "take a look at Jitsi": evaluated, adopted)

- **Jitsi, self-hosted** (open-source; one modest VPS; P2P mode for 1:1 calls barely loads the server). Embedded via `lib-jitsi-meet` so our chrome (timer, notepad, partner list) wraps a bare video surface.
- Behind the **video-provider interface** (create room / issue token / close room) — Daily/LiveKit/JaaS swap is config, not rewrite. Local dev: `jitsi/docker-jitsi-meet`.
- Ops notes: TURN server for restrictive networks; VPS can be suspended between events.

## Organizer live console

Grid of all rooms with **connection status only (never video feeds)**; who dropped/never showed; pause/extend current round; re-pair on the fly; broadcast banner announcements; remove a disruptive user instantly. Post-event: attendance, match-rate stats, feedback survey (module 2's survey primitive).

## Safety (first-class)

Report button on every encounter (during call + end-of-event form); personal block list ("never pair me with them again", enforced in rotation across all future events); organizer report review; admin platform ban list; **no recording, ever** — an explicit product promise.

## Waitlist & balance

Capacity per side; waitlist auto-promotes only when it preserves the event's configured balance.

## Primitives used

Question engine, orgs/membership (join requests), video provider interface (owner), Socket.IO orchestration (owner), notifications, email (event alerts), surveys, match records, audit log.

## Future enhancements

Paid ticketing (Stripe, shared with module 5's payments slot); networking/mentorship event skins; module 1 score-seeded rotations.
